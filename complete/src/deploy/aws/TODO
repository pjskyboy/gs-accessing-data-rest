Need to complete an exercise to create

   aws ec2 describe-key-pairs > key-pairs.json
   aws ec2 describe-security-groups > security-groups.json
   aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers > elbv2-load-balancers.json
   aws elbv2 describe-target-groups > elbv2-target-groups.json
   aws ec2 describe-vpcs > ec2-vpcs.json    - vpc-392eea50 is the one to look at
   aws ec2 describe-subnets    - subnet-83c820f8   and     subnet-83c820f8
   aws ec2 describe-images > ec2-images.json

Still worth generating image with s/w inside or just scp files using the keys we make earlier?
Do we care once we have a working image - to test layout? If necessary we just rebuild image as needed?

Repeat for scaling, RDS, replication, S3 etc etc

HOw to conver to a cloudformation template ?
